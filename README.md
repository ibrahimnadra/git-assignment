Craeted a Java Project :- 
1. A Main class that contains a main method. The main method should print out "Hello, world!".
2. A Person class that has the following attributes:
     a. name - a string that represents the name of the person.
     b. age - an integer that represents the age of the person.
     
On feature-branch :-
1. Added a new method to the Person class that returns a boolean indicating whether the person is an adult (age >= 18).
2. Updated the Main class to create a Person object and use the new method to check if the person is an adult.
